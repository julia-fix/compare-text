# Compare Text

## App Purpose

Comparing two texts for differences, might be useful to resolve git conflicts. There are many other tools like this, but I decided to create this one to have an option to ignore whitespaces or line breaks.

## Available Scripts

Can be run with `npm run [script name]` or `yarn [script name]`

### `predeploy`

Runs `npm run build` before deploying

### `deploy`

Deploys build to GitHub Pages

### `start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
